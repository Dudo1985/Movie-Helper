Movie Helper allows you to easily add links to movie and tv shows, just by searching them while you're writing your content. Search, click, done!

## Description

I run a site that talks about movies and TV series. Every month, very long lists of news from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney +, etc. are published.
To make the list more interesting, a link to IMDB is added to each entry. A very slow and tedious procedure!
Hence the idea of creating Movie Helper! With Movie Helper you can simply search for the title you need, click on the cover and it will automatically be inserted in the post!
No shortcodes needed, no custom posts, just click and go!

## Development
https://github.com/Dudo1985/Movie-Helper

## How To use

## Editing content

Below the editor, you will find a new box where you will able to search for a movie or a tv show.
If you are using the classic editor, search and click the image to insert the link to the post.
If you're using the new Gutenberg editor, search and click the image to create a list. Once you've done, click "insert"
to insert the list to the post.
